# 32x32-LED-Array-Mortarboard
I equipped my university graduation cap with a 32Ã—32 LED array, an Arduino Mega, three SPDT switches, a 2000mAh li-ion battery, lots of wire, and lots of Arduino code. By doing this I was able to display numerous animations, pictures, and text on the LED grid. This repository contains all of the Arduino code and bitmaps that I used to make it.
